# UDT Core JavaScript library

**Warning:** This code is based on an [outdated draft of the UDT spec](./docs/format.md). The [UDT spec](../../spec/README.md) is currently evolving in a different direction and, once it stabilises a bit, this library will be updated accordingly.

-----

A Node.js library for parsing, manipulating and serialising design token data in the [UDT](https://udt.design/) (Universal Design Tokens) format.

⚠️ This library is still in the very early stages of development! Docs will be added, once it takes a firmer shape.
