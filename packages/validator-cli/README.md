# UDT validation CLI
A command-line utility for validating UDT files against the [UDT specification](https://github.com/universal-design-tokens/udt/tree/master/packages/spec#readme)'s JSON schema.

Note, validation only checks that the _syntax_ of the UDT files conforms to the spec. There are additional constraints that UDT files must adhere to, which cannot be checked by JSON schema validation alone.
